# from_scratch
This repository has created for my learning and understanding of the ML concepts.

It is just using numpy. Also implemented just by looking into Wikipedia or articles that doesn't contain actual code.

Scikit-learn package is used just for downloading necessary dataset.

Let's learn by doing it.

**Note:** These implementations are part of my learning process. Code may contain bugs, numerical instability. Feel free to notify me
